<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<h2>This is my Buisness card.</h2>
<p>I created this .html file myself because I wanted the challence of a new language. I picked html up pretty quickly in my IT Fundamentals+ course at CHS. There, I also completed the full year during the first simester. I'd say I'm a fast learner, but that would undersell my experience. So far, I've:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built 4 computers, a 5th soon to come.</li>
<li>Became proficient with Google's online suite of office apps as well as most Microsoft office apps (including Access and other DBMS systems.)</li>
<li>Assisted the System/Network Administrator at RCMS (which included gaining admin credentials and independantly repairing laptops.)</li>
<li>Independantly created and hosted a Minecraft server (complete with port forwarding, simple java commands, and hours of troublshooting experience.)</li>
<li>Studied Networking+ in a dual enrollment course (with security+ next on the menu.)</li>
<li>Became the go-to IT guy for family, friends, and teachers.<li/>
</ul>
<h3>And the best has yet to come...</h3>
